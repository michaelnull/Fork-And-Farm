# Fork-And-Farm
final project for the June 29th The Iron Yard Little Rock .Net course featuring a Supplier/Purchaser portal for locally grown produce
The overall purpose of this project is to highlight the programmer's marketable skills. 

This project presents a Many Suppliers to Few Purchasers portal available to users within a limited geographical area to trade non-differentiated food items.  The end goals are to reduce the transportation footprint of the food supply chain and to offer an efficient marketing channel to low volume farmers and gardeners.  In the online environment, suppliers can announce what they intend to sell, the date they will have it available and what price they want.  Conversely, high volume purchasers such as grocers, restaurants and cafeterias (such as those in schools, prisons and military installations) can announce what they intend to buy, when they want it and what they are willing to pay.  Within the digital environment purchasers and suppliers can communicate with one another privately and agree to terms such as price, delivery and payment method. 

The stipulation for non-differentiated food items would allow for a purchaser to fill an order from multiple suppliers.  For example, if Purchaser 1 needs 100 pounds of potatoes delivered on Monday, Supplier A could bring 30 pounds, Supplier B could bring 50 pounds and Supplier C could bring 20 pounds.  If the purchaser normally brings in goods from an out-of-state supply chain, he could reduce the quantity or frequency of deliveries by the amount he can get from local suppliers through the portal.  Purchasers may gain value from one or more of: decreased price, increased quality, supporting local growers, or reducing the supply chain environmental impact.
